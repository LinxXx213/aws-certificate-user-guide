# Validating domain ownership<a name="domain-ownership-validation"></a>

Before the Amazon certificate authority \(CA\) can issue a certificate for your site, AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) must prove that you own or control all of the domain names that you specify in your request\. You can choose to prove your ownership with either domain name system \(DNS\) validation or with email validation at the time you request a certificate\. 

**Note**  
Validation applies only to publicly trusted certificates issued by ACM\. ACM does not validate domain ownership for [imported certificates](import-certificate.md) or for certificates signed by a private CA\.

In general, we recommend using DNS validation over email validation for the following reasons:
+ If you use Amazon RouteÂ 53 to manage your public DNS records, you can update your records through ACM directly\.
+ ACM automatically renews DNS\-validated certificates for as long as a certificate is in use and the DNS record is in place\. Certificates validated using email must be revalidated after 825 days\.

 If you lack authorization to edit your domain's DNS database, you must use [email validation](email-validation.md) instead\.
