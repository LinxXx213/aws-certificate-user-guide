# Amazon EventBridge support for ACM<a name="supported-events"></a>

This topic lists and describes the ACM related events supported by Amazon EventBridge\.

## AWS health events<a name="health-event"></a>

ACM generates AWS health events in response to changes in the state of a certificate\. 

One of the following event type codes is included with each event\. The codes are exposed as variables that you can use for filtering\.
+ `AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_STATE_CHANGE` \(the certificate has been renewed, has expired, or is due to expire\)
+ `CAA_CHECK_FAILURE` \(CAA check failed\)
+ `AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_FAILURE` \(for certificates signed by a private CA\)

Health events have the following structure\. In this example, an `AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_STATE_CHANGE` event has been generated\.

```
{
   "source":[
      "aws.health"
   ],
   "detail-type":[
      "AWS Health Event"
   ],
   "detail":{
      "service":[
         "ACM"
      ],
      "eventTypeCategory":[
         "scheduledChange"
      ],
      "eventTypeCode":[
         "AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_STATE_CHANGE"
      ]
   }
}
```

## ACM expiration events<a name="expiration-event"></a>

Certificates generated by ACM renew automatically, but imported certificates need to be re\-issued and re\-imported into ACM prior to expiration to avoid outages\. ACM expiration events are generated to provide notice of approaching expiration\. 

Expiration events have the following structure\.

```
